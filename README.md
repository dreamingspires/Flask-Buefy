# Flask-Buefy

Flask-Buefy packages [Buefy](https://buefy.org) into an extension that consists of a blueprint named `beufy`.  It can serve the relevant web packages from the default CDNs, making use of [Flask-Assets](https://flask-assets.readthedocs.io) to do so.

This repository takes inspiration from [Flask-Bootstrap](https://github.com/mbr/flask-bootstrap).

We aim to eventually integrate with the relevant parts of `Vue.js` for accessing components client-side, encouraging SSR where possible.
